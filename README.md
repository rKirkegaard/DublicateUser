# DublicateUser
Do you have a web organization based on users helping creating the content in a given period, and afterwards the needs of disabling the same users? Or do you need to duplicate a user who is on vacation, or a longer leave, letting a temporary user (placed at the same domain, containing the same domains to administrate and associated with the same roles) to do the work of the user, who is on leave? And are you tired of manually administrate who should be enabled and who should be disabled?  The objective of the Duplicate User module is to be able to do this in a quick way with functionality integrated directly into the User Manager in Sitecore.
